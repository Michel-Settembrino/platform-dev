Feature: Taxonomy browser
  In order to test ‘Taxonomy browser’ feature
  As an administrator
  I want to make sure ‘Taxonomy browser’ allows creating blocks with taxonomy vocabularies and filter by terms

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role

  @api @theme_wip
  Scenario: Administrator user creates a new view to show the taxonomy block.
    Given a content view with machine name "view_articles" is available
    When I go to "/admin/structure/views/view/view_articles"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    Then I should see the text "Master details"
    #Page display
    And I press the "edit-displays-top-add-display-page" button
    Then I should see the text "Page details"
    When I go to "/admin/structure/views/nojs/display/view_articles/page_1/path_en"
    Then I should see the text "Page: The menu path or URL of this view"
    And I fill in "edit-path" with "/view-articles"

    And I press the "Apply" button
